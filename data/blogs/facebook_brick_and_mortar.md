## What is all the fuss about

Facebook is 15 years old. In the last few years they have gotten an absolute beating in the press for major privacy and data protection concerns. The irony of the situation is that many of these concerns have been true of Facebook for most of its history. So why are people kicking up a fuss now? Much of the reason is because of their size and profitability. If Facebook wasn't making as much money as they were, you probably wouldn't read about its privacy concerns in the press.

Why do companies have to become bohemaths in order for people to start thinking about what the company means for their online privacy. The answer lies in how badly we generally appreciate what using the internet involves. For example, for most people searching something on Google does not differ conceptually from looking something up in an encyclopedia, other than it being much more convenient and accurate. The reality is that, those two actions are more different than they are alike.

The way that the internet works is hard to fully grasp, espescially when you bring in what it means for our privacy. To help understand the privacy implications of using services like Google and Facebook it can often be helpful to understand what their services would look like if you replaced computers with people. In other words, what would it look like if Google was a giant real world library that somehow was involved in the adverts you see on TV. This post aims to demonstrate this by imagining Facebook as a real world brick and mortar company.

In order for this thought experiment to work you need to suppress the idea that this is ridiculous and would never work, because you are right, it is ridiculous and would never work. This is a thought experiement not a business plan ðŸ˜€.

## The thought experiment

Ok, so imagine Facebook was a big building in your city and the only way you could use their service was by going to their offices and engaging with your dedicated client manager. Your friends keep telling you that you should join. They tell you that their client manager keeps them up to date with what everyone is up to. Additionally, they argue that it is the best way to share the cool things they are doing with each other, via each others client managers.

So one day you decide to sign up. You you get in your car and drive down to their offices. You walk up to the receptionist and he hands you a form to fill in. The form asks you for basic information like your name, birthday, gender etc. You fill it out and give it back to the receptionist. He asks you take a seat while he finds you the perfect client manager. Eventualy a door opens, and out comes a slim dashing man holding a clipboard. He scans the waiting area, until he sees you and comes rushing over.
"Hi, my name is Darren. I will be your Facebook client manager. You are going to love Facebook, I can tell. There are already a lot of people who have been wanting to be your friend on Facebook".

"Umm.. Hi Darren." you stutter, not knowing what you expected.

Darren didn't seem to notice your hesitation and just launched straight into his list of things he needed from you.

"Ok, so to get started you first need to tell me who all your friends are?"

"Excuse me?" you blurt out, not knowing why you are feeling sheepish.

"Oh, don't worry" Darren tries to reassure you. "There is no reason to be shy. I am your client manager, I am here to help you connect with your friends, trust me, you will get the hang of it soon. So lets start with your closest friends".

"Umm... Ok". You concede and begin to list some of your friends. Darren is furiously taking notes as you talk.

When you finish your list of 10 friends, he looks up and says "Brilliant, thank you, if you don't mind just giving me a few minutes I will be back in second.". He leaves you and briefly returns with a box filled with who-knows-what. He sits down and says "Ok, you are gonna love this.". You look at him and then the box and then back up at him. You can't help like feel you have somehow joined a cult. Darren reaches into the box, and pulls out a stack of photos and hands them to you. They are photos from your friend Gina's recent trip to South America.

"Wow, these photos are amazing", you think to yourself. "I wish I could go there".

"They are pretty awesome right!" Darren says. You almost fall of your chair. You got so engrossed in the photos that you forgot he was even there. Once you regain your composure, you hand the photos back and aggree. "Yeah, they are pretty cool."

"Do you want me to tell Gina", Darren asks.

"Exuse me?" you reply confused.

"Yeah, she comes here before and after work and sometimes during lunch." Darren continued. "I can pass a message to her client manager to let her know that you thought her photos were cool."

"Um... I guess. Thanks" you reply slightly confused.

"Great!". Darren puts the photos to one side and reaches into the box. This time he pulls out a magazine, and opens up the magazine to a folded page. "Your buddy Mike, read this yesterday" Darren says while handing you the magazine. "He said it was the funniest thing he had ever read". You take the magazine and look at the title "If cats were politicians". You start to read and soon a smile turns into a chuckle. You turn the page, and there is a picture of a cat with a judge's wig on, that just cracks you up.

"This is so cool" You say looking back up at Darren. "What else you got?". The next 45 minutes just flew by as Darren shows you everything from photos from your friends wedding to accidental messages written by your friend's cat walking accross the keyboard. You look at your watch and blurt out "Ah no! I got to go! I am going to be late for my appointment."

"No problem!" Darren says standing up with an out stretched hand. "It was great to meet you and remember I am here 24/7. I look forward to seeing you again". You shake his hand and rush out of the Facebook offices with a smile on your face, still thinking about that cat article.

That night you are at a party, and you and your friend Andrew are chatting. After your third or fourth beer you start reminiscing about old days.

"Those guys were crazy" you say talking about your school friends. "I can't believe the things we got up to"

"You know Jonesie has a kid now..." Andrew says taking a sip of his beer.

"No way!" you say, "I haven't seen him since school. Do you still meet up with him?"

"No" Andrew says, "My Facebook client manager told me". This surprised you and got you thinking about what else they know up there.

When you leave the party you decide to swing by the Facebook offices. As you walk in you ask for Darren and in seconds, he comes marching out the door holding a box under one arm and his trusty clipboard in the other hand. Darren motions to a table and as he sits down, reaches into his box.

"I was wondering if you could tell me about my mate from school called Jonesie" you interrupt, while Darren is rummaging through his box. He looks up excited and grabs his clipboard.

"You first need to be a friends on facebook." He says. "And while we're at it we might as well add a few more friends, most of your friends have hundreds of friends on Facebook".

"What?" you exclaim. "Did you say hundreds?".

"Yeah" Darren answered.

"That would explain why I always feel so out of the loop", you think to yourself. "How many friends does Andrew have?".

Darren looks down at his clipboard and after turning a few pages replies, "429".
"429!" You cry out. "In what world does Andrew have 429 friends". You take a breath and then with a sense of indignation address Darren. "Ok let's do this". You start listing all the friends you know. This only comes to about 50 people so to avoid looking like a loner in front of Darren you start listing people who aren't really friends but rather people you know. Eventually, even this list runs dry and you know you are only at about 120. You look up at Darren half expecting him to be making fun of you for your lack of friends, but instead turns to his clipboard.

"What about Amanda Trike?" he asks.

"Amanda Trike?" you repeat, slightly dismayed. "Who is Amanda Tri...". You trail off as the name comes back to you. "Is she the girl Andrew introduced me to earlier at the party? How do you know about her?" This really freaks you out. Do they have some kind of spy that follows you around?

"Yeah, that's the one." Darren replies seeing your distrust but not seeming to be disturbed by it. "Amanda's client manager showed me a photo of the three of you at that party and I know that Amanda is a friend of Andrew's. So I was just wondering if you would like to make her a friend on Facebook."

You look blankly. "I guess it makes sense" you think. Its just weird that Darren knows. "Sure" you reply trying not to think about it too much. You will take any friend you can find to get your numbers up.

"Cool" Darren replies "I will let her client manager know and she will respond when she is next in the office."

"Ok." You say quietly. You suddenly feel quite exhausted. "I think that's enough for me. I am going to take off".

"No problem." Darren replies. "But before you leave I think you might be interested in this." He reaches into his box while you sit down slightly intrigued about what he is about to show you. He emerges from his box with a video camera. He opens the viewer and hands it to you. You look at the viewer and on the screen is a baby taking its first steps. The baby holds out his hands like a person walking on a rope between two buildings. "What is this?" you say as you lift your hand to close the viewer. Before Darren could reply the baby trips and falls and starts crying, and then your mate Jonesie comes into the screen. He picks up the baby, and comforts it. "Jonesie!" you exclaim quitely to yourself. "I can't believe thats you, and that you have a kid." The whole thing gets a bit much as all the good memories come flooding back and mix in with this old friend holding his new child. You press the replay button and then press it again. And again. After several replays, you don't know what to do with all these emotions, so you slam the viewer shut and look up from the camera. Darren is just sitting there. He holds out his hands to take the camera back. You hesitate. The camera all of a sudden takes on immense value.

"This is Jonesies, I can't give it you" you say, fully realising that it is Darren who gave to you in the first place. It just doesn't feel right that Darren should have this. He doesn't even know Jonesie. He doesn't know the things he went through and how special this video of him holding his child is.

Darren retracts his hands looks on knowingly. "I understand how you feel but remember if it wasn't for me you would never have seen this".

The words swirl around in your brain and eventually you concede. You hand the camera back feeling grateful for having recieved it but guilty for giving it up. You stand up and leave the Facebook offices. As you make your way to your car, you notice the constant flow of cars and people arriving and leaving Facebook offices. When you get to your car, you turn around and look back. You think about what Facebook is doing and can understand the value but it just feels not quite right. As you look on, the video of Jonesies baby comes rushing into your thoughts, and it brings a smile to your face. You get in your car and go home.

Over the next few months, you have become so familiar with the ins and outs of using facebook. You have also managed to aquire almost 500 friends, and feel like you are constantly in the loop of whats going on. You have also begun to like Darren. In fact, if you haven't seen him in a few hours you start to miss him. But everything changed one day while you were at the pharmacy.

Recently, as Darren has been showing you photos of your friends on their summer vacations you begin to feel like you need to start working out more. So as part of your new workout plan you find yourself at the pharmacy browsing through different muscle building protein powders. As you are reading through the ingredients, you hear a familiar scratching of pencil on paper. You look up quickly and in the corner of your eye you seem someone hurriedly move behind one of the aisles. You look down again and pretend to read. Soon the scratching noise appears and as it does you look up quickly towards the end of the aisle.

"Darren!!!" you shout out. Darren moves quickly behind the aisle but you know it was him. You run after him shouting, "Darren, I know it was you. What the hell are you doing here. Are you spying on me!". Eventually, you catch up to him and when you do, you demand an explanation.

This is the first time you see Darren looking nervous. He explains: "Well, basically, all client managers at facebook get notified when you enter a participating store or venue".

"What do you mean 'participating' store?" you interrupt.

"Some stores or venues ask us to show personalised adverts to customers who come into their store. We can do that because we know so much about each of our users.". He paused. "Thats why that shop attendent tried to sell you a vacation package when you came into the pharmacy."

This surprises you. You think back to when you entered the store. You remember the lady, and you remember thinking, this is such a coincidence. Seeing all my friends vacation pictures did get you thinking about planning a trip and then all of a sudden this lady appears with the perfect all-inclusive vacation.

Darren continued, "So when you enter store, the store calls us up and asks what kind of things you like or want. When the call comes the respectve client manager informs them of the things you may be interested and rush down to the shop to see what you do. The shop allows this and this helps us to further understand what each person likes or wants, which feeds into this endless cylce of knowledge."

"Wait, so how long have you been following me?" you reply totally perplexed.

"Ever since we met", Darren says quietly looking down at the floor.

"This is so messed up." you exclaim feeling the volume of your voice getting louder and louder. "Who the hell do you think you are. Surely this is illegal. Isn't privacy like a human right. You better know, people are going to find out about this, and when they do its going to be the end of you and your twisted organisation"

"They already know", Darren replied blankly. "They already know, but few client managers make the mistake I made of being seen. Most people just come into the office to see what their friends are up to and see relevant adverts everywhere they go. Our work runs frantically in the background, behind closed doors, and most people never notice. Also, don't forget I have been spent hours and hours with you and never once did you pay me anything. Didn't you ever wonder how I get paid?."

After the pharmacy incident, you stop going to the Facebook offices but for some reason leave your account open. You know, just for incase. A few weeks goes by, and you are at home with nothing to do. The images of Jonesie's baby start appearing in your mind again. You wonder what they are up to. And Andrew, you haven't seen him in ages. You wonder if he is still going on about his veganism. You reflect on what happened a few weeks ago and decide that it can't be so bad if everyone knows about it but still goes there. So after some mental gymnastics you justify how Facebook works and drive over to their offices to see what's new.

## Closing thoughts

If you are anything like me, this kind of thought experiment helps crystalise the issues surrounding online privacy and tracking. It also helps provide a framework to figure out how we should respond to the realities of using the internet. But that is the content for another blog post.

For now, I can leave you with this: privacy in the real world is much easier to understand and comprehend than privacy on the internet. There are many facets that don't exist in the real world, but exist on the internet. So instead of hindering the progress of the internet by confining it to our real world concepts, we should instead be creative in building tools that continue to advance internet technologies while at the same time fortifying the the things that make us most human.
