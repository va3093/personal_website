People often ask me what I do for a living. When I respond by saying that I work in crypto the most common response usually contains much confusion and misunderstanding about the space and what is happening in it. One day, I told someone that I worked in crypto and she responded by saying: "I wish there was a kids book out there that would explain crypto to me". This stuck with me and the more I thought about it the more I thought it would be a great project to take on.

The only problem was:

I had never published a book before and had no idea where to start.

## Phase 1: Come up with the content of the book

The initial idea was to write a book that explained how the blockchain worked to kids. This proved to be very challenging because there are so many base concepts of the blockchain that make no sense to a child because the way money works currently does not make sense. To describe the value of decentralization to a child who doesn't really understand the concept of centralization is a bit like telling a joke and then explaining why it is funny. Furthermore, describing how decentralization is achieved is more of a challenge.

So I took a step back and thought about what aspects of the blockchain kids would find genuinely engaging and exciting to learn about. I came up with 2 things:

- endless creativity
- radical inclusiveness

These concepts are what makes working in crypto so fun and is one of the stark differences between crypto / web3 and the existing financial system.

So I focused on these two values and came up with a simple story of a coin called Ethy who goes on an adventure to find a little girl on her birthday.

## Phase 2: Find an illustrator

Finding an illustrator luckily was not the hard part. I already knew [someone](https://www.instagram.com/jackseymourillustration) who did amazing illustrations and luckily was within my budget. The hard part was transferring my vision for the illustrations over to his brain. What made this harder was that he was not familiar with crypto at all so many of the concepts had no foundation in his mind.

He was very good and his process was very helpful. We started with some very rough sketches to make sure what he had interpreted from my ramblings was correct.

He then added some ink to his sketches to help me get a better idea of how they were going to come out.

And then finally, he added the paint.

Not only did he nail all the very fine details I wanted to be included. He also introduced so many of his own that really helped pull the story together. For example, I love the contrast between the scene of Ethy crying and the next page.That was all his idea and really helps emphasize a pivot in the story.

If anyone is looking for an illustrator, I can highly recommend him. You can contact him on [his Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jackseymourillustration).

## Phase 3: Publish

Just like the previous 2 phases. I knew nothing about how to publish a book. I ended up deciding to self publish because I wanted to have more control over the future of the book. This is in contrast to selling the rights of the book to a publishing company and letting them run with it.

During this exploration, I discovered [Kindle Direct Publishing](https://kdp.amazon.com/en_US/). The concept behind Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP) is so powerful. In essence it's an on-demand book publishing platform. The way it works is that you send Amazon your book in a digital form that matches the specification of their printers exactly. Amazon then distributes these files to all their facilities around the world. Then when anyone, anywhere in the world orders your book, they print it, package it and ship it (often with next day delivery). It's so crazy. You don't have to hold any stock and don't have to worry about shifting stock around between Amazon warehouses.

Unfortunately, KDP is more designed for novel-like books and not for children's books. The paper quality is not that great and the print quality could also be a lot better. But since, I was on a small budget and the reach of KDP compared to printing and distributing it myself resulted in me just deciding to go with them as an MVP.

Through much trial and error, I managed to get my book into the correct format that was accepted by Amazon. I then had to read through endless paperwork related to selling products in the US. After a bit of back and forth with KDP I finally managed to get my book [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Ethy-blockchain-wilhelmvdwalt/dp/B099ZPJKW1) ðŸŽ‰.

## Final thoughts

And just like that, I became a published author. It was a very rewarding experience and I am really proud of how it came out. I hope that whoever comes across this book will enjoy reading it. I hope it will make kids laugh and that in some way they will associate the blockchain with radical inclusiveness and endless creativity :) #wagmi
