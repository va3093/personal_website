The desire for growth has been the driver behind our success as a species but at the cost of being content with what we have.

Every financial quarter I read about investors responses to all the companies earnings report. What I find interesting is that if Google reports that they made \$33.7 billion in profit the stock price could potentially go down unless it is an improvement on the same quarter last year. The reasons for this are numerous, but it strikes me that this desire for growth is at the centre of our sense of peace and contentment with our current state in life.

Picture the owner of a pub in Edinburgh. He makes approximately £80 000 a year and lives in a modest house in the suburbs and works 6 days a week. If I asked you to guess how pleased this person is with their life your guess would be as good as flipping a coin.

However, if I told you that this person, progressed from being a barman to owning the pub and recently moved out of shared accommodation into his own house, you would probably guess that this person is pretty pleased with how things are and you would probably be right.

If I told you that this person has gone from owning 3 pubs and because of Covid-19 had to sell the other 2 for less than he bought them for, you would probably say he is not pleased.

What I find interesting about this is that if you look at this person's life as a snapshot both scenarios look exactly the same. Whether he has gone from being a barman to owning the pub or gone from owning 3 pubs to owning one, right now he has one pub. So if the snapshot of this person's life is the same in both scenarios why is his assessment of its acceptability so different.

The reason, I think, is because we dwell on the past and live in the future. What these two points create is a gradient and whether we like it or not our content in life is dependent on the gradient. When the gradient is positive there is growth and growth = contentment. When the gradient is negative or even straight it indicates no growth which results in discontentment.

This is the reason why the super rich are often not happy and why the poorest of the poor can often report high levels of contentment despite their day to day chaos.

If our goal is to be at peace or content in life, then realising that the thing standing in our way is the gradient of our life puts us one step closer to achieving our goal, because the problem now shifts from the abstract goal of how do I find peace in life, to how do I address the fact that my peace is tied to the gradient in my life. Here are some approaches you could take.

## 1. Always ensure you have a positive gradient

Ensuring that your life is continually getting better is the approach most people take with out realising it. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our experience of life, and if we are continually successful in this we are likely to report a high degree of contentment.

This approach is not reliable because there is a limit to how many times you can increase the comfort or pleasure in your life. Most people cannot continue to acquire more and more money until they die. Most people cannot continue to continue progressing in their career until they day they die. Your wealth, career or relationships are also heavily dependent on external factors that are not in your control, which can thwart your plans for maintaining a positive gradient.

The key to this approach is attaching your sense of growth to something that is more resilient and more sustainable than wealth, fame or success. This is easier said than done. We have a family friend loves fishing. When you see him, he tells you stories of his recent fishing adventures, and is always on the hunt for a bigger fish or more cunning ways to catch fish. You can sense that his progress in this hobby brings him great joy and contentment. I can picture him going to bed with a smile on his face after a good days fishing. Having hobbies and finding ways to continually grow in them is very effective in ensure a constant positive gradient. Although hobbies do require some financing they are usually more resilient to the ups and downs of peoples financial situations. Moreover, unlike money or success, old age usually provides more scope for growth.

An example that is more resilient than hobbies is curiosity. People who are genuinely curious experience growth in their lives when they have time to investigate new knowledge or experiences. Progress in their career is exciting not only because the money and prestige but because of the new exposure they get to interesting challenges. However, times when they are most excited is when they are left to their own devices to explore and learn. A genuine curiosity is extremely resilient to external economic pressures and can be invested in deep into retirement.

As you can see keeping the gradient positive seems like an obvious thing to do but is slightly more nuanced than first meets the eye. Focusing on the obvious things like comfort, success and praise will likely fail us in adulthood and will almost definitely fail us in old age. However, if we think out of the box we can orientate our lives around things that can continue to grow and bring us joy until the day we die.

## 2. Live in the present

The gradient that dictates our sense of contentment or restlessness is necessitated by their being two points. However, the distance between these two points is arbitrary. Our subconscious seems to pick these points somewhere in the range of a few months to a few years. The second approach I would like to talk about, asks the question:

<<<<<<< HEAD
“What happens if we brought the dots so close together that they became the same dot”. If there was only one dot then there would be no gradient. If there was no gradient does that mean there would be no peace or contentment.

![](/blog_resources/gradient_of_life/TimelineAnimated-cropped-compressed.gif)

Millions of people across thousands of years would answer that question with a resounding “No”. Religions like Buddhism and some parts of Hinduism make living in this state their aim. Living in this state would be living completely in the present with no regard of the past and no regard of the future. Buddhists refer to this as escaping the cycle of life and death and attaining Nirvana or liberations. Hindus call this state Samadhi. They claim that when the dots are truly brought together and your experience is totally engrossed in the present you experience something much more profound than peace or contentment or anything that can be explained in words. I have never experienced this myself, but it is conceivable to me that it must be a completely overwhelming and profound experience.

These communities have also developed tools and practises to decrease the effort required to enter in these states and they continually endeavour to live their whole life completely engrossed in the present. Even Jesus hinted at this on his Sermon on the mount where he said that we should be like the birds and the flowers, not worrying about the future because God will provide. The implication here is that the promise of Gods provision should liberate us from the thoughts of the future and allow us to live in the present. Despite this, monotheistic religions and the west in general have historical not be strong advocates for this approach of finding a deep sense of peace and contentment. In recent decades, western thinkers like Alan Watts and Eckhart Tolle have attempted to bring these ideas and practices to the west and only recently has their work started finding traction.

The practise of meditation is becoming more mainstream, and ordinary people are starting to spend small portions of their lives doing simple exercises like focusing on their breathing. These exercises are a long way from experiencing Nirvana or Samadhi, but they are a step in the right direction. Many thought leaders in the West like Yuval Noah Harrari and Sam Harris freely talk about their deep explorations into meditative and reflective practises that form the bedrock of their sense of peace with existence.

I think that bringing the two dots together is a great approach to discovering a deep sense of peace and contentment and think that the West have a lot to learn from the East in this regard.

## 3. Live inside a story that extends beyond your life

The final approach I want to cover is the opposite of the previous one. Instead of bringing the dots together move them further apart. If you do this you will quickly reach the extremities of your life (i.e birth and death). It is at this point that we look to ideologies to explain how we fit in before we were born and after we die.

Many of the monotheistic religions tell a story that starts with the sin of humanity, their restoration to the divine and their everlasting existence in paradise for believers despite what you are going through on earth. In this story, there is a very clear positive gradient and it is this gradient that brings millions of people around the world a profound sense of peace and contentment. For a Christian that has gone through a divorce, lost custody of their children and is now unemployed, they can close their eyes in worship and sing the words “Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, That saved a wretch like me, I once was lost, but now am found, Was blind but now I see”. Despite their very steep downward trajectory they push the dots on their graph to the extremes and see that their current decline is a blip in the divines plan for their life and that even though they are in decline now, the overall trajectory is upwards. This positive contextualisation is extremely powerful and has given hope to millions of people throughout the world in dire situations.

Final thoughts

Personally, I try and subscribe to a mixture of the methods as I think they are all beneficial even if not in their complete form. However, the most enlightening aspect is the knowledge that when I feel a sense of unrest in myself I can usually quite easily link it to a lack of growth in recent weeks / months and try direct my efforts to one of the three approaches above to re-contextualise my experience and tap into the peace that is already there.
